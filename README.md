Solarize is a CRM (Customer Relationship Manager) designed specifically for the rapidly growing solar industry. We have designed an all-in-one system which functions as a landing page/lead generator as well as a fully operational CRM. Once an inquiry form is submitted from the landing page, the lead information is stored in a client database. The sales reps who use the system can then access these particular leads based on particular search criteria. (state, project type, availability, etc). Each solar company using this system will have an administrator who can distribute the leads accordingly to its sales reps. Each rep can then work the leads through the system and call them by clicking on the leadâ€™s entered phone number by clicking it in the system to follow best practices in terms of lead contact/follow-up. The major technologies used for this application are React.js, Twillio, Bulma CSS, Node.js, MySQL, Sequelize, and Express.
